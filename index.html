        My name is Jeff Daquioag and I am currently working as a Rework Technician for Apple Computer, a FoodJets pilot, and a student at UC Davis Extension's Coding Boot Camp.  I amd a graduate at UC Riverside have a Bachelor's in International Relations and an Associate's in Computer Science.
        <br><br>
        My hobbies and interests include video games, coding, and building computers.  Since I began studying Computer Science, I have started many of my own projects outside of class, as well as attempting to contribute to various open source projects (in a very limited sense as I'm no expert).  Personal projects include a "Pokemon"-style battle game in C++, and a sidescroller web game using Javascript.  On the web development side I've created a somewhat interactive website on how to play Chess as a final class project.  I also maintain a simple website with VN walkthroughs using pretty much only HTML.
        <br><br>       
        It seems that pursuing a career in programming and/or development is the most suitable course for me, isn't it?<br><br>
        Outside of computers and video games, I enjoy playing basketball.  I'm also a huge professional basketball and football fan.</p>
